# JS to Python Converter

A **JavaScript to Python Converter** built as a full-stack application that allows developers to seamlessly translate JavaScript code into Python. This tool is designed to assist developers in understanding and converting JavaScript syntax to Python, enabling smooth cross-language development.

## 🚀 Features

- **Code Translation**: Converts JavaScript code into Python syntax accurately.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Enter JavaScript code and instantly view the Python equivalent.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for ease of use.
- **Core Compiler Functionalities**:
  - **Tokenization**: Breaks down JavaScript code into tokens for processing.
  - **Parsing**: Analyzes the structure of JavaScript code.
  - **Syntax Tree Processing**: Converts JavaScript syntax into Python-compatible syntax.
  - **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Generates an intermediate form of code for efficient processing.
- **Backend Processing**: Utilizes Flask for backend logic.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for quick conversions.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Input JavaScript Code**: Users input JavaScript code into the provided text editor.
2. **Tokenization**: The code is broken into smaller components (tokens).
3. **Parsing**: The tokens are analyzed to understand the structure of the code.
4. **Translation**: The parsed JavaScript code is converted into Python syntax.
5. **Output Python Code**: The translated Python code is displayed.

## 🖥️ Demo

### Example Input (JavaScript):
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Example Output (Python):
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
